# INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON

A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE is a formal system consisting of a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. It allows a programmer to express computations and algorithms in a way that can be executed by a computer. Programming languages are used to create software, applications, and websites.
Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, Ruby, and many others. Each language has its own syntax, rules, and features, making it suitable for specific types of applications or tasks.
PYTHON is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability.Guido van Rossum created Python, and it was first released in 1991.Python's popularity has grown significantly, and it is widely used in both industry and academia for variousÂ applications.

PYTHON has become a dominant language in the field of data analysis, and its importance for data analysts is underscored by several key factors:

EASE OF LEARNING and USE:
Python's syntax is clear and readable, making it accessible for beginners. Its simplicity allows data analysts to focus on solving problems rather than dealing with complex language constructs.

RICH ECOSYSTEM OF LIBRARIES:
Python boasts a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that are specifically designed for data analysis. Notable examples include NumPy for numerical computing, pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning.

DATA VISUALIZATION:
Python provides powerful tools for data visualization, allowing analysts to create compelling charts, graphs, and interactive visualizations. Libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly enable data analysts to communicate their findings effectively.

DATA MANIPULATION and CLEANING:
The pandas library in Python is instrumental for data manipulation and cleaning tasks. It simplifies tasks such as filtering, sorting, grouping, merging, and handling missing data, making data preparation more efficient.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
Python provides extensive support for statistical analysis. Libraries like SciPy complement NumPy by offering statistical functions and tests. Statsmodels is another library dedicated to statistical modeling.

INTERDISCIPLINARY INTEGRATION:
Python is not limited to data analysis; it serves as a versatile language for integration with other disciplines. Data analysts can easily collaborate with data scientists, software developers, and domain experts, fostering interdisciplinary communication.

BIG DATA and DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING:
Python has gained prominence in big data analytics through frameworks such as Apache Spark, which has Python APIs. This allows data analysts to scale their analyses for large datasets and distributed computing environments.

COMMUNITY AND SUPPORT:
Python has a vibrant and supportive community. This community-driven nature ensures continuous development, updates, and a wealth of resources for data analysts, including tutorials, forums, and documentation.

JOB MARKET DEMAND:
Python is widely used in the industry, and many companies seek data analysts with Python proficiency. Job market demand for Python skills in data analysis roles is consistently high.

OPEN SOURCE PHILOSOPHY:
Python is open source, meaning that it is freely available and can be modified and distributed. This fosters innovation and collaboration within the data analysis community.

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. In the context of Python (or any other programming language), an IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development. Key components typically founf in Python IDE includes; 
CODE EDITOR
DEBUGGER
COMPILER/INTERPRETER INTEGRATION
PROJECT MANAGEMENT
VERSION CONTROL INTEGRATION
CODE NAVIGATION
AUTO-COMPLETION
INTEGRATED TERMINAL
TESTING TOOLS
CODE PROFILING

PYTHON has a variety of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that cater to different preferences and requirements, we have PyCharm, VScode, Jupyter Notebooks, Spyder, IDLE, Atom, Thonny, Anaconda Navigator and Eclipse with PyDEv.
For this study,we are using JUPYTER Notebooks.
Jupyter is an open-source project that allows creating and sharing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebooks are popular for data science and interactive computing.
In summary, Python's simplicity, extensive libraries, and versatility make it a powerful and essential tool for data analysts. Its adoption has contributed to a more seamless and efficient workflow in the field of data analysis.
